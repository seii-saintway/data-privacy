#### Ross Ulbricht: The man who saved Bitcoin is in prison

Compared with the brilliance of Bitcoin today, its birth is trivial.
On January 3, 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto personally created the first block -- the Genesis Block of Bitcoin, on a small server in Helsinki, Finland, and obtained the first transaction automatically generated by the system. With the reward of 50 Bitcoins, the first Bitcoin came out.
For a long time after that, the world did not pay attention to this new invention -- what is the use of this thing? Satoshi Nakamoto is a recognized genius, he did not answer. In December 2010, Satoshi Nakamoto left his last message on the Internet and never appeared again.

In the one or two years after its birth, Bitcoin has been maintained at 0.1 dollar each. The famous story of 10,000 Bitcoins for pizza happened at this time. Bitcoin has a genius design, but it is a useless design. Satoshi Nakamoto, like Shakespeare, wrote a perfect script, but no one can interpret it. Until Bitcoin meets another "genius". Ross Ulbricht, born in 1984, has been involved in drug trafficking since college. The US government has strict control over drugs, and Ross has never been able to make the drug manufacturing and trafficking business bigger and stronger. Until 2010, Ross heard the existence of Bitcoin from customers, which became a turning point.

The core of the government's crackdown on illegal activities is the supervision of funds -- the core behind it is the banking system, which is firmly controlled by the government. Bitcoin is the payment tool that breaks away from the banking system -— until now, banks and Bitcoin still go their separate ways. In January 2011, only 26 years old Ross founded a "Deep Web", commonly known as the darknet. Ross named the site Silk Road, meaning a place where commodities are traded. The "Silk Road" does not trade tea, silk, or porcelain. This is the most famous and notorious "darknet" in history. The main trading objects of this website are drugs, sex slaves, child pornography, private killers, arms trading, and identity fraud. All illegal transactions have gathered on the "Silk Road." In the end, even Ross himself was deeply involved. He used a high deposit to hire a killer to kill a Canadian user who invaded the seller's computer and blackmailed him. With the rise of the Silk Road, Bitcoin finally found its first application scenario -- a payment tool for criminal transactions. Statistics show that the Silk Road used to circulate more than 9.5 million Bitcoins, accounting for 80% of the Bitcoin circulation at that time.

In August 2013, Ross was arrested in a public library in San Francisco. In 2015, he was sentenced to life imprisonment by the court and cannot be released from prison early. The demand for darkness is also a demand. Just like the consensus of fools, it is also a consensus. Driven by criminal transactions, Bitcoin ushered in its first surge, reaching 31 dollar in June 2011. Two months after Ross was arrested, Bitcoin rose to 1,100 dollar each.

Conclusively, Ross Ulbricht is an extremely important figure in the history of Bitcoin development. When Bitcoin is about to be ignored by the world, it ends the history of Bitcoin as a toy and gives it the meaning of the real world -- serving crime.

"Criminals are the most able to embrace new technologies." BitUniverse partner Xu Zhihong concluded. But in the long struggle, the police department has mastered Bitcoin's traceability technology. More black transactions turned to more difficult-to-track digital currencies such as Monero. Bitcoin has embarked on a long and bearish journey that lasted several years.

* https://github.com/hoprnet/hoprnet
* https://docs.hoprnet.org/en/latest/src/running-hoprd/funding/native-tokens.html

https://hoprnet.jobbase.io/

* Lead research and development efforts on the intersection between decentralized networks and privacy infrastructure
* Design, implement and refine the HOPR protocol. You can see the HOPR protocol at https://github.com/hoprnet
* The current version of the HOPR protocol is the bare minimal core that needs a wealth of interconnected components to make a privacy-respecting web3 stack a reality. You are expected to design and implement these layers with a growing team. Examples are overlay networks, packet retransmission, routing in a decentralized setting and dynamic resource allocation

* Desire to work on the future of privacy and trail-blaze the future of non-corporate work
* Theoretical knowledge and practical experience with the internet protocol stack and protocols, minimally: IP, TCP, UDP, (QUIC,) DNS, WebRTC
* Familiarity with mixnet infrastructure and Tor along with existing limitations and issues
* Familiarity with mechanisms and common issues, minimally: proxies, NAT, firewalls, packet loss & retransmission
* Minimally 5 years hands-on development experience delivering Javascript applications in production settings

* Experience with libp2p
* Familiarity with elliptic curve cryptographic in theory and practice in general and pairing-based cryptography specifically
* Zero knowledge protocols such as zk-SNARKs, Bulletproofs, zk-STARKs, zk-Rollups, Optimistic Rollups

* Secure HOPR sponsored and third-party nodes (VMs) which will engage in cover traffic for a period of two years. These nodes will hold a value totalling 10.4M HOPR tokens, at a market price of 0.6 USD, this is the equivalent of holding circa 6.4M USD in digital assets.

* Desire to work on the future of privacy and trail-blaze the future of non-corporate work
* Knowledge around securing services within a DMZ, ensuring only specific ports and access are given to users within the system.
* Monitoring experience on master nodes (e.g. validators within a DPoS blockchain)

* Familiarity with common issues and mechanisms, minimally: proxies, NAT, firewalls, packet loss & retransmission, WebRTC
* Layer 2 scaling solutions such as state channels on top of Ethereum
* Ethereum tooling: Solidity, web3.js, Truffle, Ganache, OpenZeppellin
