    "#### Ross Ulbricht: The man who saved Bitcoin is in prison\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared with the brilliance of Bitcoin today, its birth is trivial.\n",
    "On January 3, 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto personally created the first block -- the Genesis Block of Bitcoin, on a small server in Helsinki, Finland, and obtained the first transaction automatically generated by the system. With the reward of 50 Bitcoins, the first Bitcoin came out.\n",
    "For a long time after that, the world did not pay attention to this new invention -- what is the use of this thing? Satoshi Nakamoto is a recognized genius, he did not answer. In December 2010, Satoshi Nakamoto left his last message on the Internet and never appeared again.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the one or two years after its birth, Bitcoin has been maintained at 0.1 dollar each. The famous story of 10,000 Bitcoins for pizza happened at this time. Bitcoin has a genius design, but it is a useless design. Satoshi Nakamoto, like Shakespeare, wrote a perfect script, but no one can interpret it. Until Bitcoin meets another \"genius\". Ross Ulbricht, born in 1984, has been involved in drug trafficking since college. The US government has strict control over drugs, and Ross has never been able to make the drug manufacturing and trafficking business bigger and stronger. Until 2010, Ross heard the existence of Bitcoin from customers, which became a turning point.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of the government's crackdown on illegal activities is the supervision of funds -- the core behind it is the banking system, which is firmly controlled by the government. Bitcoin is the payment tool that breaks away from the banking system -— until now, banks and Bitcoin still go their separate ways. In January 2011, only 26 years old Ross founded a \"Deep Web\", commonly known as the darknet. Ross named the site Silk Road, meaning a place where commodities are traded. The \"Silk Road\" does not trade tea, silk, or porcelain. This is the most famous and notorious \"darknet\" in history. The main trading objects of this website are drugs, sex slaves, child pornography, private killers, arms trading, and identity fraud. All illegal transactions have gathered on the \"Silk Road.\" In the end, even Ross himself was deeply involved. He used a high deposit to hire a killer to kill a Canadian user who invaded the seller's computer and blackmailed him. With the rise of the Silk Road, Bitcoin finally found its first application scenario -- a payment tool for criminal transactions. Statistics show that the Silk Road used to circulate more than 9.5 million Bitcoins, accounting for 80% of the Bitcoin circulation at that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In August 2013, Ross was arrested in a public library in San Francisco. In 2015, he was sentenced to life imprisonment by the court and cannot be released from prison early. The demand for darkness is also a demand. Just like the consensus of fools, it is also a consensus. Driven by criminal transactions, Bitcoin ushered in its first surge, reaching 31 dollar in June 2011. Two months after Ross was arrested, Bitcoin rose to 1,100 dollar each.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusively, Ross Ulbricht is an extremely important figure in the history of Bitcoin development. When Bitcoin is about to be ignored by the world, it ends the history of Bitcoin as a toy and gives it the meaning of the real world -- serving crime.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Criminals are the most able to embrace new technologies.\" BitUniverse partner Xu Zhihong concluded. But in the long struggle, the police department has mastered Bitcoin's traceability technology. More black transactions turned to more difficult-to-track digital currencies such as Monero. Bitcoin has embarked on a long and bearish journey that lasted several years."
